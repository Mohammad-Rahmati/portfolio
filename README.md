- Hi, I’m Mohammad Rahmati ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/111oRa), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/111ora/)).
- I’m interested in quantitative trading strategies and data science.
- I’m currently learning portfolio management and researching related projects. 
- I have developed a quantitative risk management barometer ([QRM](https://github.com/Mohammad-Rahmati/QRM_barometer)). The QRM barometer is a proprietary research that compiles data from different sources and combines them to measure the overall risk in the market. The barometer predicted local bottoms and tops in US stock market from 2011 with high accuracy. Although the method of calculating the QRM barometer is not available online, the daily QRM outputs are shared on Twitter. Check [@QRM_SPY_BTC](https://twitter.com/QRM_SPY_BTC) for more information. The barometer could be used as an effective input in machine learning models. The [rebalancing_strategy_ML_MPT](https://github.com/Mohammad-Rahmati/Rebalancing_Strategy_ML_MPT), uses the QRM barometer to improve the performance of a rebalancing strategy in a cash/SPY portfolio.
