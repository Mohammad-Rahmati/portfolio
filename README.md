- Hi, I’m @Mohammad-Rahmati (Twitter: @111ora)
- I’m interested in quantitative trading and data science.
- I’m currently learning portfolio managemenet and researching related projects. 
- I have developed a quantitative risk management barometer (QRM). The QRM is a proprietary research that compiles data from different derivative sources and compiles them to measure the overall risk in the market. Find out how it can help you decide the market condition as an leading indicator by following the Twitter account @QRM_SPY_BTC.
