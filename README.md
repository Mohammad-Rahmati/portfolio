- Hi, I’m @Mohammad-Rahmati (Twitter: @111ora)
- I’m interested in quantitative trading strategies and data science.
- I’m currently learning portfolio managemenet and researching related projects. 
- I have developed a quantitative risk management barometer ([QRM](https://github.com/Mohammad-Rahmati/QRM_barometer)). The QRM barometer is a proprietary research that compiles data from different sources and combines them to measure the overall risk in the market. The barometer is used as an input in machine learning to improve the performance of models. It predicted the weekly stock market local bottoms and tops from 2011 with high accuracy. Although the method of calculating QRM barometer is not shared online, I am uploading the daily QRM outputs on Twitter. Check out [@QRM_SPY_BTC](https://twitter.com/QRM_SPY_BTC) for more information. The barometer is used as an input for machine learning models. One of the projects, [Rebalancing_Strategy_ML_MPT](https://github.com/Mohammad-Rahmati/Rebalancing_Strategy_ML_MPT), uses the barometer to improve the performance of a rebalancing strategy in stock market. 

- Attached are QRM barometer charts (labelled as risk) vs SPY on yearly and monthly time ranges:
