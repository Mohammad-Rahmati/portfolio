- Hi, I’m @Mohammad-Rahmati (Twitter: @111ora)
- I’m interested in quantitative trading and data science.
- I’m currently learning portfolio managemenet and researching related projects. 
- I have developed a quantitative risk management barometer (QRM) and a rebalancing strategy using modern portfolio theory. The QRM barometer is a proprietary research that compiles data from different derivative sources and combines them to measure the overall risk in the market. The barometer is used as an input in machine learning to improve the performance of the models. The barometer preciously predicted the weekly stock market local bottoms and tops from 2011. I am uploading the daily QRM charts on Twitter. Find out how it can help you decide the market condition as an leading indicator by following the Twitter account @QRM_SPY_BTC.
