- Hi, I’m Mohammad Rahmati ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/111oRa)).
- I’m interested in quantitative trading strategies and data science.
- I’m currently learning portfolio managemenet and researching related projects. 
- I have developed a quantitative risk management barometer ([QRM](https://github.com/Mohammad-Rahmati/QRM_barometer)). The QRM barometer is a proprietary research that compiles data from different sources and combines them to measure the overall risk in the market. The barometer predicted local bottoms and tops in US stock market from 2011 with high accuracy. Although the method of calculating QRM barometer is not available online, the daily QRM outputs are shared on Twitter. Check out [@QRM_SPY_BTC](https://twitter.com/QRM_SPY_BTC) for more information. The barometer is used as an effective input in machine learning models. The [rebalancing_strategy_ML_MPT](https://github.com/Mohammad-Rahmati/Rebalancing_Strategy_ML_MPT), uses the QRM barometer to improve the performance of a rebalancing strategy in a cash/SPY portfolio.

#### The following projects including my data science works for companies, academic, and self-learning:
